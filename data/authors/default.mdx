## Hey there <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" />

I'm **Mohit Nagaraj**, a passionate software engineer from **Bengaluru, India**. I'm currently pursuing my B.E. in **Computer Science and Engineering** at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (2022 - 2026), and I've been building cool things on the web ever since I touched JavaScript ✨.

I love working with technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Go**, and **Flutter**, and I enjoy experimenting with infrastructure tools like **Docker**, **Redis**, and **AWS**. Whether it's crafting smooth front-end experiences or scaling backends with microservices - I'm all in 💻🚀

This blog is where I share my learnings, document the dev journey, and write about whatever tech rabbit hole I'm exploring. Hopefully, it helps someone else too!

はじめまして、よろしくお願いします。

I'm currently learning Japanese and am interested in Japanese culture. I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.

Besides coding, I’m into:

- Playing chess ♟️
- Watching anime & tech podcasts 🎧
- Random late-night walks just to think 💭
