## Introduction

As a developer, building projects is only half the journey... hosting them online is what turns them into something real and shareable.

Whether you’re building a personal portfolio, an API, or a full-stack app, there are several **completely free platforms** that let you deploy and manage your projects professionally.

Here’s how you can set up your **domain, frontend, backend, and database** , all without spending a rupee.

---

## 1. Get a Free Domain with GitHub Student Pack + Namecheap

If you’re a student, start with the **GitHub Student Developer Pack**.  
It gives you access to dozens of premium tools, including a **free `.me` domain for one year** from Namecheap.

You can claim it, choose your own domain (like `yourname.me`), and connect it to any hosting platform such as Vercel or Render.

It’s the easiest way to make your projects look professional right from the start.

## 2. Hosting Your Frontend

Your frontend whether it’s built with React, Next.js, or plain HTML/CSS can be hosted on popular free platforms like:

- **Vercel** — best for React and Next.js
- **Netlify** — great for static sites
- **GitHub Pages** — ideal for portfolios or documentation

All of them support automatic deployments directly from GitHub.  
Every time you push a change, your site updates instantly.  
You can also link your custom domain from Namecheap to make it public under your `.me` domain.

## 3. Hosting Your Backend

For your backend (like Node.js, Flask, Go, or Django APIs), there are great free-tier options:

- **Render** – simple GitHub integration and free SSL
- **Railway.app** – free monthly runtime, great for APIs
- **AWS EC2 (Free Tier)** – gives you one small cloud server free for a year, running 24/7.

**😅 Heads Up:** AWS Free Tier is like a cat... friendly when calm, but scratchy if you forget to shut things down. Keep an eye on your dashboard and check your usage once in a while 🙃.!

These platforms let you deploy APIs or backend services that your frontend can connect to.  
You can later map them under subdomains like `api.yourname.me`.

💡Pro Tip: Render may pause your backend service after ~15 minutes of inactivity, hence setting up cron-jobs can help your backend stay active all the time 😉.

## 4. Free Databases and Storage

No project is complete without a place to store data or files.  
Here are a few developer-friendly services with generous free tiers:

- **Supabase** – Free Postgres database + authentication + file storage
- **MongoDB Atlas** – Free 512MB cluster
- **Firebase** – Realtime DB, Firestore, and file storage for small projects

You can use these databases to store user data, form submissions, or uploaded files ,all while keeping your project fully free.
