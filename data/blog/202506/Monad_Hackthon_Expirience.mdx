Recently, I had the chance to participate in the **Monad Web3 Hackathon**, and it was an amazing experience - intense, fun, and deeply satisfying. Here's a quick breakdown of what went down, what we built, and what made the day special.

## What is Monad?

[Monad](https://monad.xyz/) is a **high-performance, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain**. It’s been **re-invented from the ground up** to optimize both consensus and execution, enabling up to **10,000 transactions per second (TPS)**. This hackathon gave us a chance to explore its blazing-fast infrastructure hands-on.

## What We Built - _GhostPass_

We built **GhostPass**, a privacy-focused platform for **anonymous wallet verification** on the blockchain. In simple terms:

> Users can prove wallet ownership and show verified status without exposing personal information.

It’s all about **privacy** + **proof** - think of it as a zk-pass for wallets. You can checkout the code here [Github](https://github.com/Kshitijknk07/GhostPass). Dont judge us based on the stuff we wrote there due to time constraints T-T

### Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, ethers.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Hardhat for smart contract deployment & testing)
- **Wallets**: MetaMask and any EIP-1193-compatible wallet

## How It Went

Time absolutely **flew by**. When I reached the venue (late by 30 minutes due to traffic), I was honestly **blown away** - it was a **villa** setup with chill music, a swimming pool, and breakfast waiting at the entrance. The vibes? Immaculate.

We had no set plan when we arrived, but soon I synced up with **Kshitij (aka knk)** and we decided to roll with an idea around **anonymous wallet verification**.

With only **6 hours to build**, we didn't waste time. At first, we were a bit lost on how to divide the work, but our **communication clicked instantly**. We shared one ChatGPT tab, brainstormed, and began **parallel development**.

- 🔌 By lunch: API and frontend were ready.
- 📜 Smart contract: Deployed and tested.
- 🍲 Lunch: Shared a great meal with friends (some of them were super extroverted, unlike me 😅).

In the last 2 hours, we focused on **integration** and **polishing**. With just 1 hour left, we were wiped out but happy - GhostPass was fully functional.

We stepped outside to relax in the **garden**, grabbed some snacks, and talked about life before submitting our project. Honestly, it was one of those _"we did it!"_ moments.

## Why We Missed the Demo

We wanted to give the demo but knew it would take a while for our turn, and **knk had to travel back to Bannerghatta from Whitefield** - not ideal at 9 PM. So we submitted the form and left early at 7pm itself. Even with that, I reached home by **9:30 PM** and knk by **10:40 PM**.

## Final Thoughts

This hackathon wasn’t exhausting - it was **fun**, **challenging**, and **rewarding**. Got my hands dirty in Web3, worked with amazing people, and built something I’m genuinely proud of.

Until next time, Monad! 🙌
