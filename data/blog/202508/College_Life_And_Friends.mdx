## Introduction: Why This Blog Exists (And Why You Should Care)

So here we are, Friendship Day 2025, and I'm sitting here writing this blog because reality just hit me like a ton of bricks - we're in our 4th year of college, and the countdown to "real life" has officially begun. 

The boys who've been my daily dose of chaos, my emotional support system, my competition, and my biggest cheerleaders are about to scatter across the country (and probably the world). And honestly? I'm not ready for it.

This isn't your typical "oh college friends are great" blog. This is the real, unfiltered story of 9 guys who went from awkward first-year introductions to being each other's emergency contacts, life coaches, and partners-in-crime. We've seen each other at our best and worst, celebrated victories together, and picked each other up from rock bottom more times than I can count.

So grab your coffee (or whatever you're drinking), because I'm about to introduce you to the most important people in my life - the squad that made these 4 years absolutely legendary.

## Meet The Squad: The Characters of Our Story

Before I dive into the chaos, let me introduce you to the cast of characters who made this journey unforgettable. Think of this as the "Meet the Team" section of a movie, but with way more drama and inside jokes.

### Kshitij - The "Innocent" Lion (He's Not Actually Innocent)

Starting from the left - meet Kshitij, the self-proclaimed innocent one of our group. Spoiler alert: he's not innocent at all. This guy is like a walking encyclopedia with the wisdom of a 50-year-old trapped in a 21-year-old's body.

**Why he's the Lion:** This dude has guided me and the entire squad through more tough situations than I can count. When life throws curveballs (and trust me, it threw plenty), Knk is the one who somehow always knows the right thing to say or do. He's got this uncanny ability to see through BS and give advice that actually makes sense.

**The "Innocent" Act:** He keeps claiming he's innocent, but we all know better. This is the same guy who masterminded half our college adventures and somehow always managed to look like he had nothing to do with it. Classic Knk move. Dont worry macha we have seen your mind and its a secret within us.

**Knowledge Base:** The amount of random knowledge this guy has is honestly concerning. From academic stuff to life lessons to random trivia - he's like Google but with better jokes. Literally you ask him anything and he gives you a answer.

### Naman - The "I Don't Give a F" Master

Next up, we have Naman (yes, we have two Namans, because why not make things confusing?). This Naman is the complete opposite of emotional - he's our resident "IDGAF" specialist.

**The Good Friend:** But here's the thing - despite his "IDGAF" attitude, Naman is actually a really good friend. He listens to everyone before jumping to conclusions, and he's got this way of being there for people without making a big deal about it. He might act like he doesn't care, but he actually does - he just shows it differently.

**The Negative Side & Lustful Mind:** On the flip side, Naman can be really negative sometimes. He's got this tendency to see the worst in situations and people, and he's not afraid to voice his pessimistic thoughts. It's like he's always expecting things to go wrong, and sometimes his negativity can be contagious. Oh, and let's not forget - this guy's mind is absolutely spoilt. He's got the most lustful thoughts and he's not afraid to share them. It's become part of his charm, honestly. We've all learned to expect the unexpected when it comes to what's going on in Naman's head.

**The Ambitious Side:** But here's what's interesting - despite his negative outlook, Naman is actually really ambitious. He actively looks for opportunities to make stuff better and achieve something in life. He's constantly thinking about how to improve things, how to get ahead, and how to make the most of every situation. It's this weird contradiction that makes him so fascinating - he's negative about the present but optimistic about his own potential.

### Uttkarsh (Uttu) - The Life Experience Champion

Uttu is our group's walking life lesson. This guy has seen some things, done some things, and somehow lived to tell the tale. His life experience is like a masterclass in "How to Survive Everything."

**The Gaming Master:** Uttu is a master at Valorant - or at least he was, until he took retirement from the game. He's also a master of LeetCode, though he failed in real life interviews. It's this weird contradiction where he's brilliant at solving problems on paper but somehow manages to mess up when it actually matters. Classic Uttu move.

**The Coding Genius:** But here's where Uttu really shines - he does development in low-level programming, specifically in C++. This is a skill that hardly anyone learns, but he's a master at it. While the rest of us are struggling with basic programming concepts, this guy is diving deep into the fundamentals, understanding how things work at the most basic level. It's honestly impressive and slightly terrifying.

**The Unhinged Factor:** And let's not forget - Uttu is completely unhinged. There's no other way to describe it. He's got this energy that's impossible to predict, and you never know what he's going to say or do next. It's like having a human wildcard who's also a coding genius. The combination of his technical brilliance and his completely unhinged personality makes him one of the most interesting people in our group.

### Chinmai - The Mystery Man

Chinmai is our group's enigma. He's got this quiet confidence that's absolutely magnetic. When he does speak, everyone listens because you know it's going to be either profound or absolutely hilarious.

**The Presence:** He doesn't need to say much to make an impact. Just his presence in the room changes the entire vibe. It's like having a secret weapon that you don't even realize is there until you need it.

### Rishi - The Emotional Guardian Angel

Rishi is literally the most caring person I've ever met. This guy is so careful about not hurting others that sometimes I think he forgets to take care of himself. He's like our group's emotional support animal, but human.

**The Heart:** If anyone in our group is going through something, Rishi is the first one to notice and the last one to stop checking on them. He's got this radar for emotional distress that's honestly impressive.

**The "(.)(.)" Connection:** Here's the funny part - despite being polar opposites, Rishi and Naman are bonded by the most random thing: "(.)(.)". I don't even remember how this started, but it's become their thing. It's like their secret handshake but weirder.

### Naman #2 - The Other Naman

Yes, we have two Namans. No, it's not confusing at all (that's a lie, it's very confusing). This Naman brings his own unique energy to the group, and somehow having two people with the same name just makes everything more chaotic in the best way possible.

**The Europe Trip:** Oh, and did I mention? Naman has been to Europe. This guy has actually traveled and experienced different cultures, which adds another layer to his already complex personality. He's got stories from his travels that make the rest of us feel like we've been living under a rock.

**The Trio Dynamic:** Uttu, Avinash, and this Naman form a proper trio, and they have this running thing where they bully Chinmai. It's all in good fun, of course, but these three together are like a force of nature. They've got this chemistry that's both hilarious and slightly terrifying, especially for poor Chinmai who somehow always ends up being their target.

### Bhuvan - The Wild Card

Bhuvan is our group's wild card. You never know what you're going to get with this guy, and that's exactly why we love him. He's got this energy that's impossible to ignore and impossible to predict.

**The Energy:** Hes the kinda guy who you see which is the logical reasonable way for a particular decision. However the thing is: he doesnt have clue of his environment. He was about to call a person wrongly.

**The Overachiever:** Bhuvan is the overachiever of our group. He's known as the "ML God" because of his expertise in machine learning, and he's actually cleared Google Summer of Code (GSoC). While the rest of us are struggling with basic assignments, this guy is out here contributing to open source projects and getting recognized by Google. It's both inspiring and slightly demoralizing at the same time.

### Me (Mohit) - The Cushion Support Recipient

That's me! I'm the one who's been on the receiving end of the most incredible support system anyone could ask for. These guys have been my cushion when I needed to fall, my motivation when I needed to rise, and my reality check when I needed to get my act together.

### Avinash - The Survivor

Last but definitely not least, we have Avinash. This guy has been through some serious stuff in his life, and the fact that he's still standing, still smiling, and still being an amazing friend is nothing short of incredible.

**The Strength:** Avinash's story is a reminder that you never really know what someone has been through. Despite everything, he's one of the most positive and supportive people in our group. It's honestly inspiring.

**The Perspective:** Having Avinash in our group has given all of us a different perspective on life. He's taught us resilience, gratitude, and the importance of not taking anything for granted.

### Santhosh - The Quirky One

There's one more guy in our group - Santhosh. He's a bit quirky, to say the least. He's got this unique way of looking at things that's completely different from everyone else in our group.

**The Quirky Factor:** Santhosh is just... different. In the best way possible. He's got this unique perspective on life that sometimes makes us all stop and think. He sees things that the rest of us miss, and he approaches problems in ways that no one else would even consider.

**The Individual:** While the rest of us have our defined roles and dynamics, Santhosh kind of does his own thing. He's not really part of any specific subgroup or dynamic - he's just Santhosh, being Santhosh. And we love him for it.

## The Origin Story: How We Became Brothers

Let me take you back to the beginning, when we were just a bunch of awkward first-years trying to figure out where our classes were and how to work the mess food system.

### First Year: The Awkward Introduction Phase

I don't know how fortunate I am to say this, but I got the best friends I could possibly imagine. I don't know how among 70 class students I met these extraordinarily introvert people. The first class, first lab, I met KNK. I don't clearly remember how I met so many people, but all of us just met and formed a group. I consider our group to be the best one.

What started as casual "hey, what's your name?" conversations quickly turned into "let's eat lunch together" which turned into "let's do stuff together" which turned into "let's do everything together."

It wasn't until we faced our first real challenge as a group that we realized we weren't just classmates or acquaintances - we were something more.

### Why I like my group?

One of the most beautiful things about our group is how we've created this perfect balance.

**The Honesty:** We don't sugarcoat things for each other. If someone is being an idiot, we tell them. If someone needs to hear something difficult, we say it. But we always make sure they know we're saying it because we care.

**The Support:** But we're also incredibly supportive. When someone is struggling, we're there. When someone needs advice, we give it. When someone just needs to vent, we listen.

**The Cushion Effect:** There have been so many times when I've been at my lowest, and these guys have just been there. Not trying to fix everything, not giving unsolicited advice, just being present. Sometimes that's all you need.

**The Motivation Factor:** But they're not just there for the bad times. When someone achieves something, we all celebrate like it's our own victory. The healthy competition we've had has pushed all of us to be better versions of ourselves.

## The Stories: Real Moments That Made Us Brothers

### The Late Night Conversations

Some of our best moments have happened in the middle of the night, when the world is quiet and we're all just being honest with each other.

**The Deep Talks:** We've talked about everything - our fears, our dreams, our failures, our successes. We've shared things with each other that we haven't shared with anyone else.

**The Laughter:** We've also had some of the most ridiculous conversations that make absolutely no sense in the light of day. But in the moment, they're the funniest things ever.

**The Comfort:** There's something about being in a room with people who know you completely and still choose to be your friend that's incredibly comforting.

**The Game nights:** We though have transitioned from many games from valo to roblox. None of the games are interesting, but when played with y'all it was super fun. Though I was bottom fragging, all the games still felt super fun. 

### The Adventures (And Misadventures)

We've had some wild times together, from spontaneous road trips to random midnight food runs to just hanging out in someone's room until the sun comes up.

**The Road Trips:** Trust me the max our group went was wonderla. That too on bus which we got on randomly. Dont even get me started on this topic. The max plan we do is for food which is next to Chinmai's house. That also is 50-50 cause it can get cancelled any time. Hey atleast whenever we go and spend time, it just goes off. None of those days I used to worry about something. Even if 100s of things were there, all of them seemed to vanish.

**The Gofr Hackathon Experience:** This hackathon was something that brought me closer to my gang. Though the real motive was the hackathon, those discussions, free food, and the win made it way better. The thing is, all of us are very hardworking, and at the same time, we're there for each other for emotional support.

We spent days working together, coding, debugging, and somehow managing to have fun in the middle of all the stress. The free food was definitely a bonus, but it was the teamwork, the late-night coding sessions, and the way we supported each other through the challenges that made it special. We didn't just work together - we grew together.

**The Random Moments:** Sometimes the best memories are the ones you don't plan for - like that time people start random rr. Things which are just on mind comes out. Randomly start texting expressing something. This never gets old. Knk rishi chinmai n naman's daily routine it was. They used to chat about this for hours after cllg ends.

**The Cup Noodles Chronicles:** Oh man, the cup noodles memories! There used to be times when we'd come to college at 11, no mood to attend classes, go to the canteen, eat food, sit and talk, and go home at 1. Never would I trade anything for these memories. One or the other day, one or the other reason, cup noodles has been constant in our lives.

These were the moments when we just needed to escape from the stress of college life. We'd skip classes, grab some cup noodles from the canteen, and just sit there talking about everything and nothing. It wasn't about the food - it was about the company, the conversations, the feeling of being understood and accepted exactly as we were.

### The Tough Times: When We Had Each Other's Backs

Life hasn't always been easy, and we've been through some really difficult times together. But those are the moments that really showed us what our friendship was made of.

**The College Survival Story:** Let me get this straight - after 1st year, there hasn't been a single semester where it felt peaceful. Every semester was like "are we gonna get backlog this sem?" Not because of marks, but because of the extreme rules. The college was bad, the experience was bad, it was the worst. The only reason I survived was because of my friends.

There were so many times, so many cases where if not for my friends, I don't know when I would have given up. When I couldn't go somewhere or do something, they themselves went and did it for me. They literally saved my academic life multiple times.

**The Teacher Bullying Saga:** Me, Kshitij, and Naman were in the same class, and this used to trigger the teachers so much that they used to bully us even without us doing anything. The first day of first semester, first class, a teacher comes and tells us three to get up and go sit in three different corners of the class. Like, how? What can I even say to that?

But you know what? We survived that together. We laughed about it later, turned it into an inside joke, and made it through. That's what real friendship is - turning the worst experiences into something you can laugh about together.

**Personal Struggles:** We've supported each other through family issues, health problems, relationship drama, and everything in between. When one of us is going through something, we all feel it.

**Academic Stress:** College is hard, and we've all had moments where we wanted to give up. But having 8 people who believe in you even when you don't believe in yourself makes all the difference.

**Life Changes:** We've been through breakups, makeups, job offers, rejections, and everything else that life throws at you. And through it all, we've been there for each other.

## Final Thoughts: The Gift of Friendship

### The Future: What Comes Next

As we prepare to go our separate ways, I'm filled with both excitement and sadness. I'm excited for what the future holds for each of us, but I'm sad that this chapter of our friendship is coming to an end.

**The happy part:** I'm excited to see what each of us accomplishes in our lives. I'm excited to see how we grow and change and become the people we're meant to be.

**The sad part:** I'm sad that we won't be able to see each other every day, that we won't be able to have spontaneous hangouts, that we won't be able to share our daily lives with each other in the same way.

But I'm also hopeful. Hopeful that our friendship is strong enough to survive distance and time. Hopeful that we'll continue to be there for each other, even when we're far apart. Hopeful that this isn't the end of our story, but just the beginning of a new chapter.

### What These Friendships Mean to Me

These friendships mean everything to me. They've been my anchor during the stormy times and my celebration during the good times. They've been my teachers, my supporters, my challengers, and my friends. They've kept me grounded and reminded me of what's important.

When life has been good, these friendships have been my celebration. They've been there to share in my joy and to make good times even better. They've taught me about life, about love, about loss, and about what it means to be human. They've been the people I can count on, the people I can laugh with, the people I can cry with, and the people I can grow with.

Here's to many more years of friendship, many more adventures, and many more memories. Here's to us - the squad that survived college together and came out stronger on the other side.

**Happy Friendship Day. I love you all.**
